# RL_FoodDelivery 🚁🍱

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper "Multi-modal Meal Delivery Dynamic Pricing Using Deep Reinforcement Learning".



This research exploring **dynamic pricing** for food delivery platforms using **drones and ground vehicles**. A reinforcement learning (RL) approach is employed to optimize decisions for a heterogeneous population of customers.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Model a realistic urban delivery environment with drones and vehicles
- Develop a custom RL environment using Gymnasium Package
- Train deep reinforcement learning agents to optimize delivery pricing or routing using PPO. 
- Compare RL performance against heuristic baseline policies
